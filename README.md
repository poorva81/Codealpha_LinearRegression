ðŸ“Œ Third Task Completion

I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my third task as part of my CodeAlpha internship!

ðŸ§® Project: Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used: Python, Machine learning

In this project, I have developed a predictive model using linear regression to analyze salary trends based on years of experience. By leveraging data, I was able to predict how salary increases with. This project underscores the impact of data science in making informed decisions!

Do have a look at [video presentation]() in my linkedIn post.
